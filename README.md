# Foundations of Knowledge

A metaphysical theory of knowledge based on patterns of change.

## 1. Objects and Properties

### 1.1 Object Definitions

An object is defined by its collection of properties. There are no objects without properties, and an object is signified by its properties alone. Properties are the definition of an object, meaning that the object may only be described using its properties, and that itâ€™s impossible to consider an object without also considering its properties.

An object points to a set of properties that make up its definition, and a property points to a set of objects whose definitions contain it. Just as an object is defined by a set of properties, a property is defined by a set of objects. Viewed from a more grounded perspective, the set of properties that define an object are connected, due to the fact that they are experienced temporally and/or spatially near one another. 

### 1.2 Neurological Bases

The brain forms connections in order to make sense of the world, and it does so by relating concepts that become active around the same time. This ensures that a given situation, environment, etc. will stimulate the ideas relevant to the current situation, and avoid processing useless information. In a sense, this process helps optimize the organization and structure of the brain in order to perform efficiently and therefore succeed from an evolutionary standpoint.

## 2. Changes and Patterns

### 2.1 Spatial Changes

At the lowest level, changes are detected in sensory inputs over space and time. Patterns of changes are stored as concepts, which in turn make up higher-level concepts, which make even higher-level concepts, and so on. All concepts are formed using patterns of change.

For example, the visual system first detects edges- areas of contrasting light values- which is a form of change-detection over two-dimensional space, i.e. the visual field. Patterns of edges make up higher-level concepts such as shapes. Shapes are represented by the relative positions of a set of edges, such that the proportional attributes of the shape are preserved.

### 2.2 Temporal Changes

Sequential patterns represent change over time. An intuitive understanding of cause-and-effect is summed up by the following phrase: change causes change. Experiences are represented by temporal patterns, which are sequences of spatial patterns. It is assumed that each change observed is a result of past events, i.e. previous observed changes. 
	
Going back to the visual system, temporal patterns are recognized as movement. The eye detects spatial patterns of light values, which make up sequential patterns of chaning light over time. Changes between light at each time-step is represented as ordered sequences of spatial patterns. Each spatial pattern is compared to the previous spatial pattern, which allows the changing light values to be measured over time.
